# poisson-image-editing
'Poisson Image Editing' by Patrick Perez Michel Gangnet and Andrew Blake (reference [1]) is a research paper in which a technique for seamless blending images together is presented.  

'The mathematical tool at the heart of the approach is the Poisson partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions which species the Laplacian of an unknown function over the domain of interest, along with the unknown function values over the boundary of the domain.'

The main scope of this project is to implement in python the mathematical tool described in the paper. Additionally, I replicate some of the show cases presented in the paper and I compare my results with the originals. Finally, I apply the developed method in photos taken by my own and images taken from the web.
